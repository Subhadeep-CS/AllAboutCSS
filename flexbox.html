        Before we look into the CSS Flexbox,we will look into float and clear property.
        The float property:-It's just flow the element towards left or right
        Clear Property:Used to clear the float.It specifies  what element can float
        beside a given element.

        The problem is float and clear is that overflowing elment and achive responsiveness
        is problamatic here.

        a container. Flex box means flexible box

        Flexbox is one-dimensional layout method for layout items in rows and column.
