        There are more unit for describing the size other than pixel.
        There are rem,em,vw,vh,percentage etc.

        What's wrong with pixel?

        Pixels are relative to viewing device.For a device with size 1920*1080,1px is 1
        unit out of 1080/1920.

        What's Relative length?

        This units are relative to other length property.

        em:-em unit relative to parent font size.

        vw=>unit relative to 1% of viewport width. Means 100vw = 100% of viewport width.

        vh=>unit relative to 1% of viewport height. Means 100vh = 100% of viewport height.
        
        we can set it by width and height property.
