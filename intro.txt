What is CSS?

CSS stands for cascading style sheets. 

Using html we create the skeleton of a website, when we want to add some style in it we use
CSS. CSS is use to give style of the website and also CSS used to make our website 
responsive.

There are three way to add CSS in the html element:-

1.Inline CSS=>Inline means same line.When we write CSS inside the html tag with the help
of style attribute then it's called Inline CSS.

<p style="background-color:red;"></p>

2.Internal CSS=>The problem with the inline css is that it's not reusable we declare seperate
css for each element.

and second is increase the loading time.

For solve this problem we use Internal CSS. Internal means in that document.we write Internal
CSS inside the head tag.

Syntax of writing Internal CSS

<style>
    selector{property:value;}
</style>

3.External CSS==>

Problem in Internal CSS

First of all in internal css we have to write CSS for every individual document or page
Now the problem is that internal CSS is not reusable for whole document.

Second of all When webpage start loading,first load the head tag,now if put all css
inside the head tag that will take more loading time 

For these reason we use External CSS

How to write External CSS?

Now for external CSS we create a external CSS file with the extension .css

and link it on html tag with the help of <link> tag.
